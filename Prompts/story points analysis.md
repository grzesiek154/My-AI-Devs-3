# ðŸ§© Story Point Estimation - Team Template

## 1. Team Type

Team where we mix implementation of existing code components, with maintenance and some dvelopment

---

## 2. Work Type

We work on the projects implementation - it's type of job when base on some past aggrrement we implementa project for a prticualr client, we are depended here on the client decision about the timeline, the sope of the job is oftern changing during the implementation process, we need to be a littel flexible as here as we need revenou

Maintenace - here we work on the client improvements requests and incidents, so it's also part of our job with some unpredictability, we use historical data for the ticekts to prepare for the next months, but it's not alsowas precises. And the effort and resourcess neeeded are hard to measure

Software Development - custom scripts, unit tests, this is the part of the job where we can more or less predict the scope and effort needed to compte the task

## 3. Estimation Process

We estimate together during the meeting, we have tired wiht planning poker but there were situations were some of the tieam members do not know how to estimate the task, beccuase the veriaty of duties in our team is big, and not everyoine wokred on the same acrivities

---

## 4. Estimation Scale

Fibonach 1-13


---

## 5. Reference Story / Baseline

We estimate the task considering time, complexty, effort and risk

## 6. Participants in Estimation

Whole team

## 7. Challenges or Pain Points

The team started to doub that the current process is efficien enough

How to measure the person story points if somebody wokred on eg maintenance and development, considering the fact that parrt with software dev can be predicte earielr and maintenace not

How to know if we are overloaded or not, what are team max SP and each person max SP, how to caluclate it? what factors matter?

How to calcualte SP if eg max sp for a task is 13SP so if somebody is working only on maintenance he will have 13 SP for a whole iteration, wherease if soembody is working on two projects implementations each have 8SP so 16SP in total for the whole iteration

Problem with total SP in iteration for people working on different activities, and when one person combines different activities

How to correctly calcualte the bases line for the PI planning event

How to clacualte the SP base on days, meaning how during the PI planning and knowing the days team will work how to covert it to story points

---

## 8. Goals for Improvement

my goasl is to find the efficent and logical way of combining the story points in my team, so that considering different type of duties we know our bases SP for a team, base SP for a person.
