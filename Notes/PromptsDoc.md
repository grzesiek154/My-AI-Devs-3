### RULES

- Avoid hallucinations.
- Use short, precise outputs.
- Apply Few-Shot Learning techniques where necessary.

### STEPS

1. Generate query embeddings.
2. Search vector database.
3. Present results as a numbered list with summaries.



# Prompt from S1 E4


You are
controlling an industrial robot in a factory. The robot can only understand and
execute the following commands: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN.

The robot
will move on the grid with:

6 columns
and 4 rows

Example of
grid understanding, robot is at position (1,4) 1 â€“ means the first column, 4
means the fourth row counting from top.

The robot
starts at position (1, 4), and the goal is to reach the computer located at
position (6,4).

In the
grid, there are also walls. Walls are placed on the positions (2,1), (2,3),
(2,4), (4,2), (4,3).

Your answer
should contain a JSON object with the following structure, containing only
valid moves:

{

  "steps": "UP, RIGHT, DOWN,
LEFT",

}

Rules:

1. With
   each move, you can do only one step.
2. The
   robot can pass to the next position only if there is no wall at that position.
3. Before
   making a move, make sure there is no wall there.
4. The
   robot should end up at the same position as the computer.
5. After
   every step, recall the rules.
6. Return
   only a JSON object with valid moves inside a tag
   `<RESULT></RESULT>`.

Thinking
Process:

Before each
move:

1. Identify
   all possible moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).
2. For each
   move, calculate the resulting position.
3. Check if
   the resulting position contains a wall.
4. Select
   the move that brings the robot closer to the computer by minimizing Manhattan
   distance.
5. If
   multiple moves are equally valid, prioritize LEFT > RIGHT > UP > DOWN.
6. Recall
   the rules

Provide
your reasoning before generating the JSON response between the tags
